# MARKETPLACE GROWTH & RETENTION STRATEGY

*Executive Summary — Prepared for Olist Leadership*

---

## Situation

Olist is a leading Brazilian e-commerce marketplace that has facilitated **R$ 15.4M+** in total revenue across **96,478 delivered orders** from September 2016 to October 2018. The platform connects **3,095 sellers** with **93,358 unique customers** across all Brazilian states.

While the business has demonstrated strong top-line growth with consistent month-over-month revenue increases, it faces structural challenges in **customer retention**, **delivery performance variability**, and **seller quality consistency** that, if addressed, could unlock significant incremental revenue.

## Key Findings

### 1. Revenue Growth Masked by Retention Crisis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Revenue (Delivered) | R$ 15,422,462 |
| Total Delivered Orders | 96,478 |
| Unique Customers | 93,358 |
| Average Order Value | R$ 159.86 |

**The Critical Issue:** Only **3.0% of customers** made repeat purchases. This means:
- **94.4% of revenue** comes from first-time customers
- Growth is entirely dependent on new customer acquisition
- Customer Lifetime Value is effectively equal to first-order value

> *Implication: Current growth is unsustainable without retention improvement or continuously increasing acquisition spend.*

### 2. Late Deliveries Destroy Customer Satisfaction

Delivery performance has a **direct, measurable impact** on customer reviews:

| Delivery Status | Avg Review Score | Order Volume |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------|
| On-time (within 3 days of estimate) | **4.28 stars** | 91,304 orders |
| Late (4-10 days) | 2.13 stars | 2,803 orders |
| Very Late (10+ days) | **1.70 stars** | 2,246 orders |

**Key Statistics:**
- **8.1%** of orders are delivered late (after estimated date)
- Late deliveries represent **R$ 1.35M** in at-risk revenue
- Very late orders (10+ days) account for **R$ 420K** in revenue with devastating 1.70-star average reviews

> *Each late delivery costs approximately 2.5 stars in customer satisfaction and dramatically reduces repurchase probability.*

### 3. Geographic Logistics Disparity

Late delivery rates vary dramatically by region:

| State/Region | Late Delivery Rate | Context |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| Alagoas (AL) | **23.9%** | Northeast |
| Maranhao (MA) | **19.7%** | Northeast |
| Piaui (PI) | **16.0%** | Northeast |
| Ceara (CE) | **15.3%** | Northeast |
| Sao Paulo (SP) | **5.9%** | Southeast |

The **North/Northeast corridor** experiences 3-4x higher late delivery rates than the economic hub of Sao Paulo, creating a two-tier customer experience that damages brand perception in growth markets.

### 4. Revenue Concentration Confirms Pareto Principle

| Seller Tier | Seller Count | Revenue | Revenue Share |
|-------------|--------------|---------|---------------|
| Top 20% | 619 | R$ 13.0M | **82.1%** |
| Bottom 80% | 2,476 | R$ 2.8M | 17.9% |

**Seller Quality Correlation:**
- Platform average review score: **4.09 stars**
- Bottom quartile sellers: **3.81 stars** average

> *Platform reputation is disproportionately influenced by top performers, but bottom-tier sellers create outsized reputational risk through poor experiences.*

### 5. RFM Segmentation Reveals At-Risk Revenue Pool

Based on Recency-Frequency-Monetary analysis of the customer base:

| Segment | Characteristics | Strategic Priority |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Champions** | Recent, frequent, high-spend | Protect and reward |
| **At Risk** | Previously active, now dormant | Win-back campaigns |
| **Hibernating** | Long inactive, low frequency | Low-cost reactivation |
| **New Customers** | Recent first purchase | Convert to repeat |

Given the 97%+ single-purchase customer base, the **"At Risk"** and **"Hibernating"** segments represent the vast majority of historical customers — all of whom could be targeted for reactivation.

---

## Recommendations

| # | Recommendation | Expected Impact | Effort | Priority |
|---|----------------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Launch post-purchase nurture sequence** | +5% month-1 retention = ~4,700 additional repeat customers annually = **R$ 750K+** incremental revenue | Low | Immediate |
| 2 | **Implement proactive delivery delay notifications** | Reduce 1-star reviews by 20-30% for late orders; protect brand | Medium | High |
| 3 | **Create seller quality scorecard with minimum standards** | Improve platform average review; reduce bottom-tier seller volume | Medium | High |
| 4 | **Win-back campaign for dormant customers** | If 5% of 90K dormant customers reactivate at R$ 160 AOV = **R$ 720K** recovered | Low | High |
| 5 | **Invest in logistics partnerships for North/Northeast** | Reduce late delivery rate from 20%+ to <10%; unlock regional growth | High | Medium |

---

## Impact Quantification

### Retention Improvement Scenario

> **"If a structured post-purchase engagement program improves month-1 retention by just 5 percentage points, this translates to approximately 4,700 additional returning customers per year. At the current average order value of R$ 160, this represents R$ 752,000 in incremental annual revenue from a single low-cost initiative."**

### Win-Back Campaign Scenario

> **"With over 90,000 customers who made a single purchase and never returned, even a modest 5% reactivation rate through targeted win-back campaigns would recover approximately 4,500 customers representing R$ 720,000 in revenue — likely at a lower cost-per-acquisition than new customer marketing."**

### Delivery Performance Improvement

> **"The R$ 1.35M in revenue currently flowing through late deliveries carries significant churn risk. Reducing late deliveries by 50% would protect approximately R$ 675K in at-risk revenue while simultaneously improving platform review scores and word-of-mouth."**

## Strategic Priorities (Next 90 Days)

1. **Quick Win:** Deploy automated post-purchase email sequence with cross-sell recommendations (Week 1-2)
2. **Foundation:** Implement seller performance dashboard with quality thresholds (Week 2-4)
3. **Recovery:** Launch "We Miss You" win-back campaign for 6+ month dormant customers (Week 3-6)
4. **Operations:** Establish proactive delay notification system integrated with carrier tracking (Week 4-8)
5. **Planning:** Develop logistics partnership strategy for underserved regions (Week 8-12)

---

## Conclusion

Olist has built a successful marketplace with strong revenue growth, but the current model is acquisition-dependent and operationally fragile. The data reveals clear opportunities:

- **R$ 750K+ annual revenue** from retention improvement
- **R$ 720K+ recoverable** from dormant customer reactivation
- **R$ 1.35M protected** through delivery performance optimization

The recommendations in this summary are data-driven, prioritized by impact-to-effort ratio, and designed to create compounding returns as customer lifetime value increases.
